## Repository of the Experimental Game
This is an indie horror game that I'm making. I'm creating this game so that I can learn and try out some features for another project involving me and my friends.

## The Story
Ten years ago, the main character's grandma suddenly vanished, and no one could find her. One day, he receives a call from a familiar voice, telling him that his grandma has left him a house in a small town, Mongagu√°.

He doesn't believe the story, but the familiar voice makes him curious enough to go there and find out what's happening.
