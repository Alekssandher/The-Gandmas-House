# Repository of the Experimental Game

This is an indie horror game that I'm making. I'm making yhis game so yhai can learn and try some features for another project evolving me and my friends.

# The story
Ten years ago, the main character's grandma suddenly vanished, and no one could find her. Someday he receive a call from a familiar voice, telling him that his grandma has left him a house in a country city, Mongagu√°.

He doesn't believe in this story, but the known voice makes him be curious and go there to find out what's happening.
